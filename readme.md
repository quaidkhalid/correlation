# Scatter Plot Analysis with Seaborn
This repository contains a project focused on visualizing correlations between different columns in a dataset using Seaborn. The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate how scatter plots can reveal relationships and trends within the data.

Using Seaborn, a Python data visualization library, I created scatter plots to explore and analyze correlations between various columns in a dataset. Each scatter plot is tailored to highlight correlations between selected pairs of columns, helping to identify positive, negative, or no correlation.
